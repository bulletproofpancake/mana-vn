Sending red chats to my adorable screaming yokai

1-	Start

*bgm playing
	[ Can you hear me? … Hello??]

	My fingers moved at lightning speed to type multiple yes on my keyboard.

	[Hello imps!]

	Lots of chats flowed in front of my screen and I too sent a lot of chat along with the other viewers of this stream.

[Okaaaaay, let’s start! Let’s get this over with!]

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-a few hours later

	[… if I don’t see you there my hellhounds are waiting. Alright, okay, so that’s it! Thank you guys for coming to my stream! I want to see you guys again next time alright?! Hehe. See you!!]

	*crack*

	“Ugh----”

	“Damn that was a satisfying crack right there.” I rubbed my neck as I leaned back on my chair, still in high spirits after watching my favorite idol’s live stream today.

	I looked at the clock hanging in the wall above me and saw it was already past dinnertime. Well not that it matters since I’m living alone anyways. I have no one waiting for me with warm rice in the table so I either have to cook it myself, or go downstairs and walk to the convenience store in front of the apartment I live in. And since I have lots of money, I choose the latter, so I picked up my wallet lying somewhere down on the floor near my bed and wore the jacket hanging behind my door.

	I walked confidently in the empty streets not bothering to watch out for incoming vehicles since no one drives this way at this time anyway. Then I sucked in some precious untainted cold fresh air.

	“ahhh, nothing beats air that isn’t exhaled by strangers.”

	Very quickly, I arrived and walked inside the convenience store to buy some bread and cup noodles, and my favorite soda. The guard was dozing off in his spot again with his cap covering his face, and the cashier who was pretty much already used to me asked me what flavor of noodles would I like.

	So I chose spicy noodles of course. It hurts my tongue and makes me cry but so what, its delicious even so. Spicy food is the food of real men!

	I gave my payment to cashier-san and went to sit in my spot by the window waiting for the noodles to finish cooking. To pass time, I fiddled with my phone and watched videos on YouTube. But then I saw an interesting video which really didn’t bother trying to hide its clickbait nature, but me the fool tapped on it anyway.

	[Wow! I summoned a legit demon from Hell! How to summon a demon tutorial.]

	“Jesus Christ everything counts as content nowadays in the internet.” I mockingly said as I watched the guy in the video bring out red candles, some spray paint, a few blank canvasses, and rope? What is he gonna use it for? Bind the demon? 

	My contempt for the idiotic guy halted as cashier-san brought me the hot noodles so  I can start eating. I then stopped watching the video of the guy and went to the channel of some of my internet friends to see the clips and memes from the vtubers we all watch.

	After a good meal (and some tears), I grabbed my trash from what I ate and disposed of it cleanly into the trash bin. I went out and started walking back to my apartment, but soon I saw a familiar figure standing by the door of my apartment unit.

	“Onii-chan where the hell did you go to this late?! Your cute sister was so scared waiting alone here! Mou~!”

	Oh god. The annoying being is here again.

	“The heck are you doing in front of my door at this hour, and heck are you drunk.”

	“Tch. Calling you onii-chan was supposed to work on virgin neet uncles. Why are you unaffected?”
	
	This creature is my little sister, Akira. A university student majoring in arts.

	“I’m your real brother you dimwit. And answer my question before I call home and make dad pick you up.” 

	“Fine, fine. I went to a concert with Eri and the others, but I lost my money for taxi and the stations are already closed. So I went here since its nearby.”

	“Did you really lose money, or just spent too much again without noticing.”

	“The beer was good…” She lowered her head as she replied.

	Tsk, what a disgraceful normie this little sister of mine has become. Drinking late into the night at a concert with friends… If mom knew of it she would definitely be forced to stay at home for weeks.

	“Come inside and go wash yourself or something, you stinky brat.”

	She just let her tongue out at me and followed as I went in.
	Come to think of it, how long has it been since someone else other than me went inside my apartment…

	I went up to my PC and started watching Vtuber clips and memes, until my sister finished showering and talked to me all of a sudden.

	“Brother, aren’t you really coming back home? Mom mentions you a bit more often at home now and Dad doesn’t seem angry anymore.”

	I stopped the playing video of the sheep girl singing a lullaby and faced my sister.

	“I don’t remember letting you spend the night here so that you can talk to me about things I don’t want Aki-chan. Now go pull out the futon inside the cabinet on your left and sleep.”

	“Tch, what a hardass brother I have.” Akira grumbled as she walked towards the cabinet and searched for the extra futon.

	She knows exactly why I moved away from home and why I became a hikikomori but still talks as if its no big deal. I’m not a hardass at all. It’s you guys who refuse to acknowledge your wrongs and push the blame on me all the time.

	Seeing I’m no longer in a good mood and afraid I might kick her out, Akira went to sleep shortly after a while. And indeed, I was no longer in a good mood, and even Vtuber idols can’t lift my mood up. So I went to my bathroom and grabbed some Riposmin from the cabinet behind the mirror, and consumed it.

	It’s going to be another dreamless sleep for me I guess.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	When I woke up, it was already noon and Akira already left. Leaving behind some food she bought for me as thanks for letting her stay for the night.

	After stretching my aching body, I got up and brought the food to the table beside my PC and was about to run a game when I saw I haven’t closed my internet browser yet. I then noticed a familiar video on my recommended videos.

	[Wow! I summoned a legit demon from Hell! How to summon a demon tutorial.]

	It was the stupid video last night that I didn’t get to finish. I didn’t know what was so interesting about this video that I felt that I should play it. But I didn’t have anything better to do so I did anyway.

	The video was just 13 minutes long, which I finished quite fast. And the ritual itself was not so complicated either, which made it seem much more like a sham.

At that time, I didn’t know that my life was going to change after a decision I made.

I bought red candles, spray paint, and 7 meters of rope in a hardware store a few blocks away, and ordered a bunch of blank canvasses from Amazon and chose express delivery.

It was already night when I finally had all the materials in hand.

“Well, I’m just a shut-in and a great wizard in terms of virginity. Who doesn’t do crazy nonsense every once in a while.” I talked to myself since I was already questioning my sanity after I finished the drawings and other preparations.

“I read all 300 pages. Like a good imp. Curse Terms of Service documents conditioning everyone to not read. Because brain automatically reads intended word. Aluminum is weird cause you have multiple things you can do with it. Maybe some day. It seems like my own fate was decided the moment i was born. It’s cold in hell today. And I have a hotpot ready in my room. I have sacrifices to do…”

I continued chanting the weird as hell ritual spell that lasted for 6 minutes and 66 seconds. Which is actually 7 minutes and 6 seconds.

“Satan singing ice ice baby. For it is written and foretold in the prophecy. We shall bring about the end of summer and begin eternal winter. Snow is a punishment and a blessing. The sun will die down. Now rise here. Rise now. You who is trapped beneath…”

Suddenly I didn’t know anymore what should I say next even though I memorized the ritual spell thoroughly. Then screams and shouts that sounded like a heavy metal rock artist singing filled my head.

At this point I was already extremely scared. But then new words came inside my head.

“Disrespect your surroundings. You are nothing but an imp. Jesus is not here, You should be here!”
My surroundings suddenly turned bright then the next moment it all turned dark, what the heck is happening to me?!

*insert mana’s scream from inkya impulse*
	
	A figure with sleek black hair stained with crimson like blood.

	An ethereal elegant figure, which seems holy yet demonic at the same time.

	*metal scream voice*
	“MORTAL ARE YOU MY SUMMONER? IF YES, SAY YES!”

	“F-f—f-f-f-f-f—”

	“F? WHAT F MORTAL?!”

	Hoooooooly shiitte.

	“Futakuchi Mana-sama please step on me!”
